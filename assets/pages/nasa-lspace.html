							<h2>Project Overview</h2>
							<p>
								Before I dive into my experience with NASA L’SPACE, allow me to first elaborate upon the significance of this program. The NASA L’SPACE Program 
								is a 12-week interactive experience for undergraduate STEM students, aiming to prepare them for a career in the space industry. It is designed 
								to provide unique, hands-on learning and insight into the dynamic world of this industry, teaching students NASA mission procedures and protocols 
								from industry professionals. There are two L’SPACE academies, and I was a part of the Mission Concept Academy (MCA), where I collaborated with a 
								team of 12 to complete a mission-related team project. Every term there is a new project, and for my term, Spring 2024, we were tasked with 
								developing a Mars rover mission concept built to perform science on the surface and subsurface of Mars.
							</p>
	
							<h3>Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
							
							<p>
								I initially took the position of Computer Hardware Engineer and worked primarily on the Command and Data Handling (CDH) subsystem of the rover, 
								covering the data computing and telecommunication subassemblies. However, after completing the SRR, I was offered a promotion to Deputy Project 
								Manager, where I helped lead the project alongside the Project Manager and directed a Programmatics subteam, covering risk management, budget, 
								and scheduling. Amongst the two roles that I’ve mentioned, after the SRR, I was responsible for both for the remainder of the project.
							</p>

								<h3>Academy Deliverables</h3>
								<p>
									NASA L’SPACE MCA was broken up into 6 deliverables that are based on NASA’s Space Flight Project Life Cycle from NPR 7120.5E. Given the academy 
									is conceptual, we followed this design process until the end of Phase B, which is the last phase before the design is finalized and fabrication 
									of the rover begins. Below are listed the 6 deliverables that we were assigned, which span the pre-formulation and formulation of a traditional 
									NASA project life cycle.

						<h2>Mission Summary</h2>
						<p>
							The Endurance mission aims to explore Mars' surface and subsurface to uncover its geological history and assess its potential to support past and present life. 
							Utilizing a rover equipped with advanced instruments, including the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer's (MOMA) mass spectrometer and a high-resolution Microscopic 
							Imager (MI), the mission will analyze organic compounds, isotope fractionations, and the mineral composition of Martian regolith near ice deposits. This research 
							aims to identify biosignatures, understand Mars' climatic and geological history, and assess resources for future human exploration. The mission follows a strict 
							schedule and budget, ensuring efficient resource use and timely completion, with findings that will inform future Mars landing sites and the search for life and 
							water resources.
						</p>

								<h3>Overall Vehicle and System Design</h3>
								<p>
									The Endurance rover integrates multiple subsystems, each crucial for its Mars mission. Below, I’ve provided a brief overview of each subsystem, highlighting the key components and functionalities involved.

											<span class="title"><b>Mechanical Subsystem</b></span>
										</div>
										<div class="deliverable-details">
											<p>
												The mechanical subsystem of the Endurance rover encompasses the design of the chassis, wheels, suspension, arm, and collection device. 
												These components collectively ensure the rover's structural integrity, maneuverability, and physical interaction with its environment. 
												The chassis, wheels, and arm are made of aluminum 7075, chosen for its strength, light weight, and proven performance in past Mars 
												missions.
											</p>

											<p>
												The rocker-bogie suspension system, known for its maneuverability and reliability, was selected due to its success in all previous NASA 
												Mars rovers. For sample collection, a drill was chosen over a scooper to obtain ice samples rather than surface regolith mixed with ice 
												dust. A newer, lab-tested drill will be used to address past mission failures, resulting in a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 4 for 
												the mechanical subsystem.

											<span class="title"><b>Power Subsystem</b></span>
										</div>
										<div class="deliverable-details">
											<p>
												The Electrical Power System (EPS) of the Endurance rover includes power generation, storage, and distribution. Inspired by previous 
												missions like Mars Phoenix, the system uses the UltraFlex-175 solar array from Northrop Grumman, featuring thin-film, triple-junction 
												GaAs/GaInP/Ge solar cells. This array generates power during daylight, distributed by a custom power distribution unit (PDU) and stored 
												in three lithium-ion batteries from EaglePicher Technologies.
											</p>

											<p>
												During the day, the solar array powers the rover and charges the batteries. At night, to conserve energy, power-demanding components
												 are minimally used. The command and data handling computer monitors battery status, triggering "low power mode" when capacity drops to 
												 20% or if overheating occurs, shutting down non-essential systems while maintaining critical functions.
											</p>

											<p>
												To save power, the rover drives slowly (up to 100 meters per hour) and rotates the arm at 5 degrees per second. It does not operate the 
												arm and scientific instruments while moving. The drivetrain requires 30-90W, and scientific instruments need up to 70W. Power generation 
												is reduced inside the crater due to limited sunlight. The UltraFlex-175 and custom PDU have a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 4, 
												while the batteries are at TRL 5.

										</div>
										<div class="deliverable-details">
											<p>
												The Command and Data Handling (CDH) Subsystem of the Endurance rover sends commands to and stores data from all subsystems. It includes 
												Data Computing and Telecommunications subassemblies. The Telecommunications subassembly features three antennas (Ultra-High Frequency, 
												X-band High Gain, and X-band Low Gain) and an X-band transponder, enabling communication with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and 
												mission control, with built-in redundancy for reliability.
											</p>
											
											<p>
												The Data Computing subassembly uses a BAE RAD750 processor with DRAM for volatile memory and Flash Memory for long-term storage, 
												interfacing with all subsystems via SpaceWire. While these components are proven on the Perseverance Rover, they have not been tested 
												with Endurance’s specific subsystems, resulting in a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6.
											</p>

											<p>
												Together, these subassemblies manage command reception, execution, data handling, transmission, and error diagnostics. Commands from 
												Earth are processed by the central computer and executed, while collected data is transmitted to the MRO within a 6-minute window every 
												112 minutes. The system includes routines for reestablishing contact in case of signal loss, ensuring efficient data management and 
												reliable operations.
