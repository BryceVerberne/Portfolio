						<h2>Project Overview</h2>
						<p>
							Before I dive into my experience with the Coconut CubeSat, allow me to first elaborate on the Sun Devil Satellite Laboratory (SDSL) 
							and provide some details about the project. I work for the SDSL, a Fulton Student Organization at ASU dedicated to the design and 
							development of satellite and satellite-related technology. SDSL participates in various projects, including the annual AIAA CanSat 
							Competition, the Pulsed Plasma Thruster (PPT) in collaboration with JPL NASA, and, of course, the Coconut CubeSat, among many others!
						</p>
						<p>
							Currently, I am working with a team at SDSL on the Coconut CubeSat, a 1U satellite designed to relay information from remote 
							sensing devices back to the ground station at Arizona State University. This project is particularly significant for SDSL, as NASA 
							has selected the Coconut CubeSat, among submissions from universities including Harvard and Columbia, for the CubeSat Launch Initiative 
							(CSLI). The launch is scheduled to take place sometime between 2024 and 2027. Click 
							<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-announces-selection-of-candidates-for-cubesat-space-missions/" target="_blank">here</a> 
							for more information on the selection.
						</p>

						<h3>Roles & Responsibilities</h3>
						<p>
							As a Software Engineer on the Coconut CubeSat project at SDSL, I contribute to the development and deployment of software for satellite 
							operations using Ubuntu and other Linux distributions. We follow Agile methodologies, incorporating iterative phases, regular reviews 
							and feedback, and cross-functional collaboration among the software, electrical, and mechanical sub-teams.
						</p>

						<h3>Associated Organizations</h3>
						<p>
							The Coconut CubeSat is a collaboration between the Sun Devil Satellite Laboratory (SDSL), the Interplanetary Initiative at ASU, and NASA. 
							The project is divided into deliverables (e.g., PDR, PPRR, CDR) based on NASAâ€™s Space Flight Project Life Cycle. These deliverables represent 
							the culmination of work from both SDSL and the Interplanetary Initiative, regularly reviewed by NASA, with feedback provided to ensure a 
							steady development and refinement process leading up to and following the launch.
